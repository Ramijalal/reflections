 well finaly i am now on lesson 3 
-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   when i work on a project with other contributers , remote repository would be the best choice
   
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
 up-to-date with your remote repository?
   if i make git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository , then when someone makes
   any changes to the remote , the changes would also be to my local repository and i don't want
   that to hapen ,so pulling changes manualy is better 
-what are  branchs,forks and clones ?
   -branch : is a series of commits , a project can contain any number of branches 
   -clone  : cloning is copying a repository from  gihub cloud into your pc 
   - fork  : forkis a copie of a repository on github ,  forking is cloning on github from one a count 
     into another acount without having to clone in to  your computer then to github repository 
-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is actually an important thing 
    for developers so that when they are offline they would be able to check the changes on the remote 
    and even merge, compare ... , 
 this is a conflict a created on purpose
