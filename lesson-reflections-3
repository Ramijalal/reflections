 well finaly i am now on lesson 3 
-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   when i work on a project with other contributers , remote repository would be the best choice
   
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
 up-to-date with your remote repository?
   if i make git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository , then when someone makes
   any changes to the remote , the changes would also be to my local repository and i don't want
   that to hapen ,so pulling changes manualy is better
